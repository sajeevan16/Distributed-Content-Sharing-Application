# Distributed-Content-Sharing-Application
Goal Develop a simple overlay-based solution that allows a set of nodes to share contents (e.g., music files) among each other. Consider a set of nodes connected via some overlay topology. Each of the nodes has a set of files that it is willing to share with other nodes. Suppose aliveNode x is interested in a file f. x issues a search query to the overlay to locate a at least one aliveNode y containing that particular file. Once the aliveNode is identified, the file f can be exchanged between X and y.

## How to Run

You have to start the bootstrap server before running the program. Set the bootstrap properties in the Bootstrap.properties file.
